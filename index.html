        A direct translation of the word Vuosaari, Flux Island combines the figurative and literal. Flux as in flow of people, ideas, electricity, water, etc. and flux as in the substance used when soldering. Flux Island is a collaboration between Aalto Media Lab and Vuotalo gathering an exhibition, workshops, and audiovisual performances.
      </p>
      <p>The exhibition will present new media artworks that examine Vuosaari and its relationship to the Baltic Sea using interaction, generative processes, and immersion. The artworks in the exhibition are created by students and alumni of the Aalto Media Lab.</p>
      <p>During Flux Island, free workshops will be organized where participants can learn how to create their own art combining DIY tools, technology, and code. The artistic outcomes of the workshops will also become part of the exhibition.
      </p>
      <p>Finally, Flux Island presents the fifth edition of ÄÄNIAALTO, an audiovisual festival presenting striking performances from artists selected through an open call. ÄÄNIAALTO will take place at Vuosali on selected evenings during the month of February.
      </p>
      <p>Aalto Media Lab at the Department of Media at Aalto University offers interdisciplinary studies in the design and production of new media, games, and sound. The mission of the Media Lab is to explore, discover, and comprehend digital technology and its impact on society.
